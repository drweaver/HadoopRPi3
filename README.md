# HadoopRPi3
Contains scripts, settings files, pre-compiled pi Hadoop libraries and docs to setup a Hadoop cluster on a few Raspberry Pi 3 systems on a local network.

For step by step Instructions [click here](docs/HadoopRPi3-setup.txt) - Warning, these were instructions captured as I created this cluster. There may be errors - good luck!
